# 0x04-TypeScript

This Tasks is part of the **Front-End Pro Developer** course at **ALX AFRICA**.

## Description

This repository contains a progressive set of TypeScript tasks, each designed to teach and reinforce a specific concept or feature of TypeScript as used in modern front-end development. The tasks are structured to build your skills step by step, from basic type usage to advanced object-oriented and modular programming patterns.

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### task_0: TypeScript Basics and DOM Manipulation

- **Focus:**
  - Introduction to TypeScript syntax.
  - Defining and using interfaces.
  - Creating typed objects and arrays.
  - Manipulating the DOM using vanilla JavaScript.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - Type annotations for variables and function parameters.
  - Using interfaces to enforce object structure.
  - Rendering data to HTML tables dynamically.

---

### task_1: Interfaces, Classes, and Inheritance

- **Focus:**
  - Advanced interface features (optional properties, method signatures).
  - Extending interfaces to create more complex types.
  - Implementing interfaces in classes.
  - Using classes to encapsulate logic and data.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - Creating and extending interfaces.
  - Implementing interfaces in classes.
  - Using constructors and class methods.
  - Understanding and using optional properties and methods.

---

### task_2: Polymorphism and Type Guards

- **Focus:**
  - Creating shared and specialized interfaces.
  - Implementing multiple interfaces in classes.
  - Using polymorphism to return different class instances based on input.
  - Type guards to determine object/class type at runtime.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - Interface inheritance.
  - Writing factory functions that return different types.
  - Using `instanceof` or custom type guards for safe type narrowing.

---

### task_3: Modularization and Type Declarations

- **Focus:**
  - Splitting code into modules for better organization.
  - Creating and using `.d.ts` files for type declarations.
  - Importing and exporting types and functions across files.
  - Ensuring type safety when working with JavaScript and TypeScript together.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - Writing and using type declaration files.
  - Organizing code with ES6 modules.
  - Importing/exporting interfaces, types, and functions.
  - Using triple-slash directives for type references.

---

### task_4: Namespaces, Abstract Classes, and Advanced Patterns

- **Focus:**
  - Organizing code with namespaces.
  - Creating and using abstract classes.
  - Implementing inheritance and method overriding.
  - Applying advanced TypeScript features in real-world scenarios.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - Defining and using namespaces for code organization.
  - Creating abstract classes and implementing them in subclasses.
  - Overriding methods and using `super`.
  - Managing complex type relationships.
